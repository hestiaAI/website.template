paragraph1_title: We define a new relationship to data
community_title: We are a collective of users
community_description: "‹SITE-TITLE› is you and me: app users and
  people keen to understand privacy in relationships formed online. The
  collective is worried about the way our intimate life is being coded and
  exposed online. We aim to retake control of personal data on apps,
  understand the privacy problems they create, and work to improve data
  literacy."

mission_title: We work to understand what's being done
mission_description: >-
  We want to understand many privacy risks that we, as app users, are
  confronted with when looking for a date online: unwanted ads, discrimination
  resulting from data, incorrect profiling and predictions, and the possibility
  of phishing and identity theft by rogue users.


  Our ultimate goal is to bring together users and privacy enthusiasts to push for a paradigm shift.

  activists and NGOs in data protection and other related themes.


  We push ideas for better user and company practices to control personal data and date safely online. We are particularly interested in raising awareness, as well as building methodological protocols and privacy tools for data protection and literacy.
