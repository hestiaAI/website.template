  - title: We are a collective of users
    description: "Dating Privacy is you and me: dating app users and
      people keen to understand privacy in relationships formed online. The
      collective is worried about the way our intimate life is being coded and
      exposed online. We aim to retake control of personal data on dating apps,
      understand the privacy problems they create, and work to improve data
      literacy."

  - title: We work to understand what's being done
    description: >-
      We want to understand many privacy risks that we, as dating app users, are
      confronted with when looking for a date online: unwanted ads, discrimination
      resulting from data, incorrect profiling and predictions, and the possibility
      of phishing and identity theft by rogue users.
    
    
      Our ultimate goal is to bring together users and privacy enthusiasts to push for a paradigm shift.

  - title: We connect with many partners
    description: >-
      We are looking to collaborate with journalists, academics, researchers,
      activists and NGOs in data protection and other related themes.


      We push ideas for better user and company practices to control personal data and date safely online. We are particularly interested in raising awareness, as well as building methodological protocols and privacy tools for data protection and literacy.
